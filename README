This Repository includes the whole code of my Diplomarbeit.
It consist of three Parts. First of all we have the implementation of a RESTful Java web service, that realises a location server. This location server receives the location updates of mobile devices and stores them in its database. We use jersey for the REST stuff and eclipselink to connect to a apache derby DB.
The second part is the implementation of the mobile object. It has a simple GPS location tracker service that gives location updates to our fragmentation algorithm frequently. The fragmentation algorithm is the main part of research. It splits the trajectory into segments accordinmg to map information and distributes the location updates on several location servers.
Last but not least we have a sample implementation of a client application that makes a SLA with the mobile object to get access to the location information on the different location servers and be able to reconstruct the trajectory. It visualizes the trajectory on a map.
